Primary software development on Barracuda
    FreeBSD 12.1
    clang 8.0.1
    ZFS with lz4 compression

vcf-split
    Max output files about 9k before serious loss of performance
    Caused compute node lock-ups on Mortimer (CentOS 7)
    Succeeded on Peregrine

ad2vcf
    Must be done in cloud in order to access SRA CRAM files
    Fusera was the only working method at the time of processing
    SRA Tools did not have the authentication capabilities to access
    restricted SRA files, even in the cloud
    
Fusera
    Performs terribly on CentOS 8
	Fully utilizes 1 core and provides kb/s throughout
    On CentOS 7 or Amazon Linux 1, ~6 mb/s
    Tested with time cat file.cram > /dev/null

    0.41% mount failure rate on Amazon Linux 1 (82 mount failures 20k samples)
    Experienced frequent failures on both AWS and GCP

Cloud
    AWS far superior to GCP is most respects
    GCP showed better single-thread read throughput through Fusera mounts,
    but far fewer VM configuration options, terrible documentation with
    common tasks scanttered across multiple web pages, cumbersome interaction
    with instances via Google Cloud SDK (Easier to use standard tools like ssh
    and rsync with AWS)
    
    Fusera performance was not an issue with AWS since it parallelized well
    up to 60 processes and samtools is CPU-bound when decoding CRAMs anyway
    
    Scientific software installed using pkgsrc, configured by
    auto-pkgsrc-setup to compile everything using its own gcc8 package
    
    Instance automatically configured by SRA/AWS-scripts/sra-cloud-setup
